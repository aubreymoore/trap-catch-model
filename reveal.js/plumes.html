					<h4>Pheromone Trap Catch May Not Be Correlated with Population Density</h4>
					Press S to see speaker notes.
					<aside class="notes">
						In the next few slides, I am going to explain why CRB pheromone trap catch rate may not correlate with population density.

					<h4>Simple Model</h4>

					<aside class="notes">
						The relationship between pheromone trap catch and population desity is not known. However, many people assume a simple linear model.

					<h4>Pheromone trap and plume</h4>
					<img src="../source0.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's see if we can develop a better model by looking at how insect pheromone traps work.
						The red dot in this simulation represents a trap releasing pheromone molecules which disperse and are blown downwind. In this case, the wind is from the north. Insects search for pheromone plumes by flying at right angle to the wind. When they detect pheromone molecules, they turn upwind, following the plume to its source.

					<h4>Competition from natural pheromone sources<br>(low population density)</h4>
					<aside class="notes"></aside>
					<img src="../source2.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here we have added two natural pheromone sources represented as green dots. In the case of CRB, these are male adults which release the same aggregation pheromone that is used to bait traps. As you can see, even at low population levels, natural pheromone sources compete with traps. Beetles flying across the wind in the bottom half of this simulation will encounter plumes from the natural sources and fly upwind towards them rather than the trap.

					<h4>Confusion from natural pheromone sources<br>(high population density)</h4>
					<img src="../source25.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						At high population densities, the air becomes saturated with pheromone and insects can no longer follow plumes to sources. This phenomenon is well known. A control tactic for several insects called "mating disruption" involves saturating the air with synthetic pheromone. This has not been tried with CRB.

					<h4>Improved Model</h4>
					<img src="../trapcatch_vs_density.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						We can use what we know about how to impoved theoretical model of the relationship between trap catch and population density. At low population densities, trap catch increases with population density. However, at high population densities, trap catch is reduced because target insects follow plumes to natural sources instead of the traps. At extremely high population densities, target insects are unable to navigate up plumes to sources trap catch rate falls towards zero.

					<h4>Evidence of reduced pheromone trap catch at high population density</h4>
					<img src="../evidence1_resized.png" style="max-height: 50%;"/><br>
					<p style="font-size:20px">"Our results show that trap catches not only level off at high density but actually decline at extremely high density." 
					<a href="https://typeset.io/pdf/development-of-a-combined-sex-pheromone-based-monitoring-2yjusy786s.pdf">Jones et al. 2009</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Is there any evidence to support this nonlinear model?
						There is. A quick search on Google found this example. It is a journal article on pheromone trapping of forest tent caterpiller moth where the authors report that "Our results show that trap catches not only level off at high density but actually decline at extremely high density."

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>CRB pheromone traps are very usefull for detecting CRB at low population levels.</li>
						<li>However, trap catch and population density may be uncorrelated at high population levels.</li>
						<li>Perhaps other methods such as damage surveys and advanced sensors should be used for monitoring changes in CRB population density.</li>
